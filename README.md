# throw a box
It's a gabagaba physical simulator for throwing a ball while its harsh frames is still baffling me.
In it you shoule input the length and height of the screen,the default position of the box in the form of x,y,the
speed in x and y axis in the form vx,vy,and the framespeed.(the true framespeed in this virtual world is 100f/s.the framespeed just main how fast you want to watch this anime.)
